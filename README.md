### What's this?

Monitor real-time price changes through the stock code and place it on the desktop taskbar, a must-have for fishing

### What can you do?

- Use the stock code to monitor real-time price changes, and monitor one quantity (the code must be entered completely,
  such as: SZ002594)
- Monitoring interval, minimum 2 seconds
- The number of monitors, before version `v1.0.3`, can only support one, after `v1.0.3`, it can support up to two.
- If it rises, the font will be `red`. If it falls, the font will be `green`
- Added the option to no longer obtain prices after the market closes, but to obtain prices half an hour in advance
  before the market opens, time period (9:00-15:00)
