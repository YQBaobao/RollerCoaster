- Use the stock code to monitor real-time price changes, and monitor one quantity (the code must be entered completely,

- Monitoring interval, minimum 2 seconds,Default 3 seconds
- The number of monitors, before version `v1.0.3`, can only support one, after `v1.0.3`, it can support up to two.
- If it rises, the font will be `red`. If it falls, the font will be `green`
- Added that the price will no longer be obtained after the market closes (15:00). Before the market opens, the time will be checked every 1 minute and the price will be obtained at the set time (9:00). \[Note: This item relies heavily on the local time of the computer, please ensure that the time is accurate\]
